    "comment": "I worked for the Lynchburg Fire Department and the racism and mysogyny there horrified me. When I research fire depts across the country, it appears to be endemic in the culture. Firelawblog.com highlights almost monthly lawsuits and filings, yet nothing is done to prevent it or change the culture. The fire departments appear to be untouchable. Even after a 98 million dollar settlement with the NYFD, you still have cases such as those in Chicago to stop the hiring of black female firfighters. SM"

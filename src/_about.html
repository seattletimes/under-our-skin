<p>About this project:

<p>Under Our Skin grew out of conversations about how we cover race at The Seattle Times.  Like many of you, we’ve recently found ourselves talking more about race and racism, inequality and prejudice, prompted by national and local events like the deaths of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida; Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Black Lives Matter marches and the Yik Yak hate speech at Western Washington University.  

<p>As a paper, we’ve covered the local events as breaking news stories that explain the who, what and where of what happened.  But we haven’t done a lot of digging into the whys. And we’ve made mistakes.  Under Our Skin is one effort to change that.

<p>Perhaps because we’re journalists, we started with words and phrases that we noticed people were using -- and defining -- very differently.  White privilege, for example, and microaggression – even racism. We picked a dozen of them,  then invited 18 people to our video studio to share what each word means to them.  We knew we could not present all viewpoints, and we didn’t try.  But we chose people with a range of experiences, backgrounds, races and ages -- some of whom we thought could offer fresh perspectives and challenge common assumptions.  

<p>We weren’t disappointed.  In fact, we were blown away.  The conversations -- with the interviewees in the studio, sitting on a stool facing two cameras with a staff interviewer a few feet away -- were insightful, honest, thought-provoking, and sometimes funny and surprising.

<p>So come listen with us.   And we also invite you to give your reactions to what you hear, share your views on what we’ve done, or talk with friends and colleagues about the words and ideas explored in these videos.  You’ll find more information on this page about how to do so.  

<p>With many thanks to our 18 interviewees, and all of you,

<p>The Under Our Skin team

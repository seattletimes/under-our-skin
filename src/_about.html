<div class="sans">
  <p>Under Our Skin grew out of conversations about how we at The Seattle Times cover race.  Recently, we’ve found ourselves talking more candidly about race and racism, inequality and prejudice, prompted by national and local events &mdash; the police shootings of young, black men as well as Black Lives Matter marches and Yik Yak hate speech.

  <p>As a news organization, we’ve covered the local events as breaking news stories that explain  the who, what and where of what happened.  But we haven’t done enough digging into the why.  And we’ve made mistakes in how we deal with race in our stories. Under Our Skin is part of an effort to improve our coverage and, for ourselves and our readers, to provide a foundation for deeper, more thoughtful conversations.  

  <p>We decided to examine words and phrases because we noticed people were using &mdash; and understanding &mdash; many of them very differently.  We picked a dozen of them,  then invited 18 people to our video studio to share what each of those terms means to them.  We sought people with a range of experiences, backgrounds, races and ages &mdash; some of whom we thought would offer fresh perspectives and challenge common assumptions.  

  <p>The conversations went well beyond the words into each of the interviewees’ lives.  They were insightful, thought-provoking, honest and, at times, uncomfortable.

  <p>With many thanks to our 18 interviewees, and all of you,

  <p>The Under Our Skin team:
